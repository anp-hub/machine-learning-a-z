## Example: 
- You are tasked to predict sales price of car. The sales price is the dependent variable and the independent variables are the milage of the car and its' age. 

- And data that supplied to you are 100 cars in total. In general the split is 80/20.
  Train = 80%   Test = 20%
- Model: Y = b_0 + b_1 * X_1 + b_2 * X_2
  The 80% (traing data) is used to train the model
  The 20% is used to pedict price.
  As the actual prices for the data is known, find the accuracy of the model.
